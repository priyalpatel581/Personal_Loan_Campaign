# AllLife Bank — Personal Loan Adoption Prediction

Use data and machine learning to identify liability customers most likely to accept a personal loan offer, so marketing resources are targeted where they’ll have the greatest impact.

## Project Goals
- Predict the probability that a liability customer will accept a personal loan offer.
- Rank and explain the customer features that most influence adoption.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to surface behavioral patterns and segmentation opportunities.
- Build, evaluate, and compare interpretable ML models (e.g., Decision Tree, Logistic Regression), and provide actionable recommendations to optimize campaign targeting.

## Key Features
- Clean, reproducible EDA and feature engineering pipeline.
- Baseline and interpretable classification models with evaluation.
- Model comparison using accuracy, confusion matrix, precision/recall, and ROC-AUC.
- Short actionable playbook for marketing to prioritize outreach.

## Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
- Techniques: EDA, feature engineering, classification (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree), model evaluation, simple explainability (feature importance, partial dependence as applicable)
